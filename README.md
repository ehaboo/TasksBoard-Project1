## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out My First coding Project.


**To do this project, you need a basic understanding of HTML , CSS and Javascript.**

## The Project

Creating a Tasks Board where you can add note with a specific Time and Date. Each note will have a cool fade-in animation and a delete button that only appears when you hover over the note. That way, you can easily delete any notes if you want to. It's a neat way to keep track of your tasks and make the board more interactive.


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
